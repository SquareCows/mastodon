### Be Respectful –

- Don't post threatening or inflammatory content.
- Don't use the AWSCommunity mastodon instance to engage in or promote illegal or fraudulent activity, or to post illegal or fraudulent content.
- Don't post content that expresses, encourages, or promotes hatred or intolerance against others.
- Don't post your private information or content that invades the privacy of others. For example, don't post phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, or other personal information.
- Don't attempt to drown out other people's opinions, including posting from multiple accounts or coordinating with others.
- Don't engage in name-calling or otherwise attack others.
- Be patient and supportive when communicating with others. AWSCommunity mastodon is a global community, and users may not be posting in their primary language. Ask polite clarifying questions if needed to better understand other users.

### Be Helpful – 

Post content that helps address questions and advances the community’s knowledge of AWS services.

- Research before you ask. Your question may have already been answered by someone else, and repetitive content can be more distracting than helpful.
- If you can help someone please do, there are a lot of members of varying skill levels who need guidance and knowledge that you may have.

### Be Appropriate – 

AWSCommunity mastodon is a place for professionals, so keep user names and posts work and family safe for all users.

- Don't post or link to sexually explicit content.
- Don't post obscene or profane language or content.
- Don't post content that can be political in nature.
